window can be clicked to stop the capturing of traffic
on the network.

Color Coding

Different packets are seen highlighted in various 
different colors. This is Wireshark’s way of 
displaying traffic to help you easily identify the 
types of it. Default colors are:
•Light Purple color for TCP traffic
•Light Blue color for UDP traffic
•Black color identifies packets with errors – 
example these packets are delivered in an unordered manner.
To check the color coding rules click on View and 
select Coloring Rules. These color coding rules can 
be customized and modified to fit your needs.
